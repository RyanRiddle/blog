<h1>Welcome to my blog!</h1>
<p>
Hello! I am Ryan Riddle.  And this is my blog :)
</p>

<p>
I generated this post by using a clojure program I wrote.  I tried using Ghost, Jekyll, and some others.  But I had to resolve too many dependencies and learn too many ways of doing things to use them.
</p>

<p>
My clojure program has little overhead.  I write my post in the form of a clojure program and it generates html.  I will post the source soon.  Use it if you like :)  I probably won't add features to accomodate you though.  I want it to stay simple.
